# Printf: A Colorful ALX Software Engineering Team Project

Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Printf Team Project, led by the talented SamwelOkoth!

## Introduction

Our team has created a custom printf function for the C programming language, aptly named `_printf`. This function is a powerful, optimized alternative to the standard library function printf. It's designed to handle various inputs and optional arguments just like its standard counterpart.

## Features

- **High Performance:** Our `_printf()` function efficiently writes output to the standard output stream (stdout) without relying on standard library files. It's optimized to provide speedy performance for your printing needs.

- **Custom Buffer:** While the function uses a local buffer of 1024 bytes for printing, it's capable of handling larger datasets with ease.

- **Return Value:** After successfully executing, `_printf()` returns the total number of characters printed to stdout, excluding the null byte at the end of strings. In case of an output error, it returns -1.

## Function Prototype

The prototype of this function is:

```c
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
It requires one mandatory format argument, and you can provide an additional number of arguments as needed.

Format String
The format string is a crucial element of this function. It starts and ends with double quotes and can contain zero or more directives, ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications. Each conversion specification begins with a % character and ends with a conversion specifier.

Format Options
Our _printf() supports various formatting options, including:

Flags (#, 0, -, ' ', +)
Field Width
Precision
Length Modifiers (l, h)
Conversion Specifiers (d, i, o, u, x, X, c, s, p, %, b, S, r, R)
